# miscscripts
Misc helper and analysis scripts created during development the badkeys project

This repository contains various small scripts created during the badkeys
research and development.

If you are merely looking to use badkeys as a key checking tool, these are
likely not interesting. They are shared here for transparency reasons and
in order to help similar research. Each script should contain a brief
comment describing what they do.
