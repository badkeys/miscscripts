# miscscripts

This repository contains various small scripts created during the development of
[badkeys](https://badkeys.info).

If you are merely looking to use badkeys as a key checking tool, these are likely not
interesting. They are shared here for transparency reasons and in order to help similar
research. Each script should contain a brief comment describing what it does.
